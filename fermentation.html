            <p>Episode 1: In the Dining Room<br>The senior <i>A.oryzae</i> makes the junior <i>L.sakei</i> and <i>S.cerevisiae</i> eat glucose. <i>L.sakei</i> is
amazed by <i>S.cerevisiae</i>, which gobbles them up without restraint, but <i>A.oryzae</i> says, "That freshman is a horrible guy. He turns all the glucose I make into alcohol."</p>

            <p>Episode 9: A World with Less Oxygen<br>
Oxygen is low and <i>S.cerevisiae</i> is starved. <i>A.oryzae</i> hydrolyze the starch to make glucose.  <i>S.cerevisiae</i> eats the glucose and produces alcohol.</p>

            <p>Episode 10: A world with a lot of oxygen.<br>
When there is a lot of oxygen, <i>S.cerevisiae</i> breathes well and increases. He does not make alcohol.</p>

            <p>Episode 11: A World Without Oxygen 1<br><i>L.sakei</i> is a passive anaerobic lactobacillus and does not need oxygen. He recognizes that oxygen is like a dangerous drug that burns everyone up and ravages them.</p>

            <p>Episode 14: Some Oxygen Talking 2<br> <i>L.sakei</i> admonishes <i>S.cerevisiae</i> to "steadily ferment ethanol without touching the dangerous oxygen". <i>S.cerevisiae</i> looks puzzled.

            <p>Episode 15 : Calculation<br><i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. says that eukaryotes should thank their intracellular mitochondria for their high ATP synthesis efficiency.  As a non-sugar-consuming Pseudomonas genus, he says sarcastically that <i>L.sakei</i> and <i>S.cerevisiae</i> are counting on the wallet of <i>A.oryzae</i>.</p>

            <p>Episode 17: Narrowly defined<br><i>A.oryzae</i>, <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. and <i>S.cerevisiae</i> discuss to let <i>L.sakei</i>, who are obsessed with fermentation in the narrow sense of the word, which they do only in the glycolytic system, know the way of life and the position of various microorganisms. Although <i>A.oryzae</i> is recognized as "national fungus" of Japan, at this point in time, he is not interested in the convenience of human beings.</p>

            <p>Episode 27: History<br>An annoying relative, <i>Aspergillus flavus</i>, reveals to <i>A.oryzae</i>, "You must have gene that synthesizes aflatoxin, too". <i>A.oryzae</i> admits it, but he thinks that his gene for aflatoxin synthesis must have been broken from the beginning, since he fell into the steamed rice offered by ancient Japanese. He thinks back to his encounter with Japanese people that so dependent on him that almost stopped eating meat instead of eating his fermented foods.</p>

            <p>Episode 47: Convoy B2<br>The young policeman tries to show his sympathy for <i>A.oryzae</i> by saying "Fermentation and decay are distinguished by human convenience". <i>A.oryzae</i> argues that the opposite of fermentation is not decay but aerobic respiration for living creatures, in terms of energy production efficiency. The young cop is confused. He says, "You mean, like, the opposite of love is not hate but indifference?" drawing on a quote from Mother Teresa.</p>
